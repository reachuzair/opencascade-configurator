# Python Dependencies for Open Cascade Configurator
# DO NOT install with pip - Use conda instead (see below)

# PythonOCC - Open Cascade Technology bindings
# INSTALL WITH CONDA (REQUIRED):
#   conda create -n opencascade python=3.10
#   conda activate opencascade
#   conda install -c conda-forge pythonocc-core

# pythonocc-core  # Do not use pip - will fail

# Why conda?
# PythonOCC has complex C++ dependencies (OpenCASCADE, OpenGL, etc.)
# that are extremely difficult to build from source.
# Conda provides pre-built binaries with all dependencies.

# Optional: Development tools
# pytest>=7.0
# black>=23.0
